The goal of this game is for all players to dodge the incoming fire balls. The last person left standing wins the game. The game supports up to three players currently, do to keyboard restrictions. The game also currently has three changable difficulty levels. The fire balls follow a random moving algorithm. This game was developed using multiple python built in libraries including: Pygame, and Random. An AI-computer was developed to challenge players. The AI follows a moving algorithm that consists of moving in the y direction when a fire ball is coming towards it in the x direction, and it is in its y coordinate range. Similar reasoning for moving in the x direction. Optimization was considered, like using python's built in list to append current fire balls to a list instead of using a linked List which has a worse big-OH running time for appending to the end.
